Note to team: (written 9:43PM Feb 11)

Let's meet tomorrow Thursday Feb 12.

We still need to finish:
- Storyboard (Zach) 
 NOTE: (have 80% done) I ended up making a (very) rough UI, need to take pictures and create a flow chart.

- All the Use Cases
- All the JUnit Tests
- Release Plan - Someone should take responsibility for this like Zach did for storyboard so that it gets done DIBS OUT
- Clean up the wiki side bar

I'm done my Use Cases (UC4-6) and their JUnit Tests so you can use them to help you make yours.
