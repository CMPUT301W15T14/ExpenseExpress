Uploaded some code for version 0.1 (this would be for Part 4). They are all based on Zach's detailed Storyboard Walkthrough which was awesome. I've been doing them in AndroidStudio at home so I only pushed the java file. When I get to school tomorrow I'll set up an Eclipse project.


They are organized in the folder like this:


Models -- all 100% done including Javadocs, except for Receipt (0% done).
    There is a folder inside there called "constants" where I put classes holding constants that are convenient.


Controllers -- 1% done.
    By nature of how Android is designed, Activity does most of the "controller" stuff, but we can still use controllers that echo Model class functions to give the project a MVC smell or whatever. Basically our controllers will be middle-men.


Activities -- 5% done.

Application (convenience class) 100% done.

LoginActivity 90%? done.

ClaimsListActivity 30% done.

Utility classes -- 0% done.
    These will hold code for server communication, data storage, and things that make coding easier.
